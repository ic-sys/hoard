# Executive summary

## What is Hoard

With the Hoard platform we are setting out to achieve 3 things:

1. Disrupting the virtual asset market by bringing blockchain technology to video games - enabling gamers to have True Ownership over their virtual processings.

2. Disrupting the way of financing games by facilitating game developers in creating TGEs \(Token Generation Events\) to have their games funded directly by their future customers, fans and investors. The Hoard platform makes it possible to create real life economy around games and bring real life value to funders.

3. Paving the way towards true virtual employment. More and more people are working on producing and selling virtual goods and services and with the Hoard platform everything can be tokenized and tradeable. Hoard will even facilitate "Mom and pop"-style shops on the Hoard exchange.

**What is a blockchain?**  
An append-only database or ledger that tracks transactions, hosted across a peer-to-peer network and cryptographically guarded from fraud. “Blockchain” is the generic term for the anti-fraud structure at the heart of Bitcoin, Ethereum and similar technologies.

Hoard is proven with a prototype and is currently in preproduction.
